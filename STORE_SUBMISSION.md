## 💡 Tips

1. **Start with TestFlight/Internal Testing**: Don't submit to production immediately
2. **Privacy Policy is Mandatory**: Both stores reject apps without one
3. **Screenshots Sell Apps**: Invest time in good screenshots
4. **Use Staged Rollout**: Google Play allows releasing to small % of users first
5. **Monitor Analytics**: Track user acquisition and retention post-launch
6. **Respond to Reviews**: Good for rankings and user satisfaction
